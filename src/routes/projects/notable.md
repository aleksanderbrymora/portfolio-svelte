# NotAble

![NotAble Showcase](/projects/notes.gif)

An app I created as a final project in General Assemblyâ€™s Bootcamp using React for frontend and Firebase as a Backend for authentication and data storage. 

It was a big deep dive into React, which was still magic to me then - probably because we were using Class based React, which was very confusing back then. 

It was a lovely experience and to this day this is one of the best stacks for me to build something extremely quickly - I wrote this whole app (while being super inexperienced) in 3 days.
