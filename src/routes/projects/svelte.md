# Svelte

As I've said about myself previously - I always look for something better to do the same job. Svelte seams to fill that space in a manner too good to be true. Especially now with Svelte Kit. I have created multiple projects using this library/compiler and I'm in love with how easy things are - especially animations. 

First project I'd done was a simple Password Generator, which you can see in the gif. I was learning it during my work for General Assembly. 

I collected my knowledge in to a nice bundle and run few lessons there teaching others how to write apps using Svelte. Here are some of my other projects using that library. 

## Password generator

A quick get to know app, for generating safe passwords. I made it to dip my toes into that library.

This website is built with the help of Svelte Kit, which is currently in beta. It's static built, so the experience is as quick as possible and caching can be as good as possible on Netlify CDN's.

I'm using a mix of simple html for some websites, compiling a mix of Markdown with some JavaScript and API routes for building sites for all of the projects. 
One of the main concerns is making the site as responsive and accessible as it can be - that means that I'm checking color contrasts, focusing on easy-to-read spacing for all the text. 
I'm also making sure to use __semantic html tags__ to improve the experience for people using Screen Readers.
