# Line following robot

![Line following robot in action](/projects/arduino-robot.gif)

This cute little robot is a culmination of a full semester of (learning) programming with few of my friends. We used Arduino to make a robot follow a black line and other guides towards the and of a track. It was my first battle with optimizations in code so the robot would keep up with all the information that was coming in. It was a life-changing experience and we have it on video!

The robot uses a whole array of sensors - Ultrasonic, IR or touch, to determine how to follow a line (or let's be real - get back to it).
